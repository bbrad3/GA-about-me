            <div class="section-div">
                <p>I am a 26 year old career changer looking for a more challenging and rewarding career. In 2018 I graduated from Colorado State University with a B.A. in Geology and have worked as an Engineering Tech and Environmental Tech. Though my professional experience I have learned that the career path I was on would not allow me to acheive my professional or personal. I am not one to settle, so I when I found coding I dove in head first!</p>

            <h2>My Experience</h2>
            <div class="section-div">
                <p>After losing my job due to the pandemic I moved home and had knee surgery. While sitting on the couch I decided to use my time wisely by learning to code. I began on the fantastic site <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" target="_blank" class="text-link">freecodecamp.org</a> where I learned the basics of HTML and CSS. I was hooked! I then took a Udemy course by Colt Steele, <em>The Web Developer Bootcamp</em>. In this course I was able to dive deeper into JavaScript, Bootstrap, and back-end programming in Node.js with Express and MongoDB. In addition to these recourses I dove deeper into <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> by reading <em>Head First JavaScript Programming A Brain-Friendly Guide</em> by Eric Freeman and Elisabeth Robson. What a fantastic resource!</p>
